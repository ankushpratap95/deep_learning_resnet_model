### Introduction

This repository contains the original model - Resnet-18, with 4.9 M parameters. In this repo we have trained our model on different optimizers like  ADAM, SGD and Adagrad models for the CIFAR-10 dataset. 

### Disclaimer 


0. If you want to train these models, please notice that:
	- GPU establishment is required. 
	- Changes of mini-batch size should impact accuracy (we use a mini-batch of 64 images).
	- We have implemeted data augmentation, dropout layers and normalization techniques for best accuracy. 
    - We are running these models on 100 epochs at 0.01 learning rate. 
    - To get the plots of respective models please uncomment the specific model and run the file for desired resut and outputs.
